  Current we can get status for the commit (comparing parent). But can't get patch text.

  I would like to have commit.patch to get patch text. Result will be similar to git diff shell command.
  ```
  git diff <c1> <c2>
  ```
  
  ```
  all_commits = repo.iter_commits('master')
  for commit in all_commits:
      print(commit.stats)
  ```

  If the community is okay with this addition, i can work on this and raise a PR.

  Thanks in advance,
  Durai Pandian
